# Punic

Punic is a lightweight and user-friendly unit testing framework for C++. It provides developers with an easy and efficient way to write and execute tests for their C++ code. Automated testing is crucial for ensuring code correctness, and C++Unit aims to simplify the process with its intuitive and flexible features.

## Features

- **Easy Integration:** Punic can be easily integrated into your C++ projects, allowing you to seamlessly incorporate unit tests into your development workflow.

- **Simple Assertion:** The framework provides an `assert` function that allows you to make assertions on the expected and actual values of your code. It supports various data types and automatically generates informative output.

- **Test Suites:** Punic allows you to group related tests into test suites. This feature helps you organize your tests based on modules, classes, or specific functionality, making it easier to manage and execute targeted tests.

- **Output Formatting:** The output of the test results is formatted in a clear and readable manner. Punic supports colored outputs, making it easier to distinguish between passed and failed tests. It also provides detailed information about assertion failures, including the expected and actual values.

- **Test Summary:** Once all the tests are executed, Punic provides a summary of the test results. It informs you about the number of tests passed and failed, allowing you to quickly assess the overall test outcome.

- **Customizable:** C++Unit is designed to be flexible and customizable. You can extend its functionality according to your specific requirements. For example, you can add additional output formatting options or integrate it with other testing tools or frameworks.
